Machine learning-based breast cancer classification using neural networks and logistic regression
# Breast Cancer Classification using Machine Learning & Neural Networks

This project classifies breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset from Scikit-learn. It implements a neural network using Keras and compares the results with logistic regression.

## Key Features
- **Neural Network**: Built using Keras, achieving ~90% accuracy.
- **Logistic Regression**: Implemented for comparison, yielding similar performance.

## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from Scikit-learn's built-in Breast Cancer Dataset. [Learn more here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer.html).

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Keras
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow
